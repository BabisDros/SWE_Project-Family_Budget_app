# Functional Scope of the Budgeting App

The Budgeting App will support the following functionality for:

- Registering a family in the system by one member who will act as the **guardian**.
- Allowing the guardian to manage the accounts of other family members.
- Allowing each member to log into their personal account using authentication.
- Enabling the guardian to manage expense categories.
- Allowing the guardian to set spending limits per category.
- Defining fixed monthly income or expense entries, including amount, start month, and end month.
- Allowing each member to record their own recurring monthly income and expenses.
- Recording non-recurring (One-Off) income and expenses.
- Allowing each member to create a savings goal ("Moneybox") for a desired purchase; at the end of each month, the guardian may allocate part of the family's surplus (if any) to one or more savings goals.
- Allocating any remaining monthly surplus as savings for that month.
- Viewing individual budgets on a monthly or yearly basis.
- Viewing the family budget on a monthly or yearly basis.
- Providing statistical information to all users regarding family budgets, such as:
  - The percentage of families with surplus or deficit budgets per month.
  - The percentage of families saving €1,000, €5,000, or €10,000 per year.

## Out of Scope

The Budgeting App **will not** provide functionality for:

- Verifying whether a user assigned as a guardian or member, actually holds that role in real life.
- Validating the correctness of income/expense categorization.
- Viewing budget data for custom date ranges.
